  Professional VWAP + RSI Scalping System v4

  ITERATION 4 - QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:
  - RSI CROSSOVER signals (not just thresholds) for entry timing
  - Stricter volume requirement (1.5x average)
  - Added occurred_within to confirm recent oversold/overbought
  - Wider stops (2x ATR) to avoid noise
  - Higher R:R (2.5:1) for better expectancy
  - Only trade when price has structure (near VWAP)
