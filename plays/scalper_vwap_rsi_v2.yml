  Professional VWAP + RSI Scalping System v2

  ITERATION 2 CHANGES:
  - Widened RSI exit thresholds (85/15 vs 80/20) - let winners run
  - Increased R:R to 2:1 for better expectancy
  - Loosened volume filter (1.1x vs 1.2x)
  - Adjusted RSI entry thresholds (40/60 vs 35/65)
  - Removed 4h trend filter to allow more trades in choppy markets
  - Added Bollinger Band squeeze filter for better volatility timing
