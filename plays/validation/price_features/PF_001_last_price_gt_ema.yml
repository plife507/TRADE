  Price Feature Suite 1 - last_price comparison with indicator.

  Exercises: last_price built-in resolution in DSL conditions,
  1m subloop evaluation (last_price updates per 1m tick),
  comparison operator with indicator feature.

  Entry when last_price > ema_20 AND rsi_14 < 60.
  Exit when last_price < ema_20.
  This validates the 1m-granular last_price is accessible
  and updates correctly within the subloop.
