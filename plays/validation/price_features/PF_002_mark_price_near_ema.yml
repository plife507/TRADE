  Price Feature Suite 2 - mark_price with near_pct operator.

  Exercises: mark_price built-in resolution, near_pct proximity
  operator with tolerance, mark_price vs indicator comparison.

  Entry when mark_price near_pct ema_50 within 1% AND rsi > 40.
  Exit when mark_price > ema_50 by more than 3% (breakaway from mean).
  Tests mark_price accessibility and near_pct semantics.
