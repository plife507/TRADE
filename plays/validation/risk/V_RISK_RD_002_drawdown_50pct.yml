  Real-Data Risk Play 2 - 50% Max Drawdown at 3x Leverage

  Enters long immediately (ema > 0 is always true) with 95% of equity
  at 3x leverage ($28,500 notional). No exit signal — position stays
  until risk event fires. A ~17.5% BTC drop triggers the 50% drawdown
  gate. Liquidation at 3x is ~34.5%, so drawdown fires first.

  Requires a BTC window with >17.5% decline.
  Feb 2025: BTC dropped ~$105K to ~$78K (~25%).
