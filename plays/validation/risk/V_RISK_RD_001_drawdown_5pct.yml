  Real-Data Risk Play 1 - 5% Max Drawdown at 3x Leverage

  Enters long immediately (ema > 0 is always true) with 95% of equity
  at 3x leverage ($28,500 notional). No exit signal — position stays
  until risk event fires. A ~1.75% BTC drop triggers the 5% drawdown
  gate. Any volatile BTC period achieves this within hours.
