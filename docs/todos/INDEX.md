## TODO Workflow

1. **Before coding**: Create or update TODO.md with planned work
2. **During work**: Check off items as completed
3. **New discoveries**: STOP, update TODOs, continue
4. **Completion**: Archive completed phase documents by date
5. **Phases**: Completed phases are FROZEN - do not modify

See [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) for full TODO-driven execution rules.
