  Validate SL auto-adjustment when beyond liquidation.
  50x leverage with 2% SL, but with on_sl_beyond_liq=adjust:
  - Original SL at 2% would be beyond liquidation (~1.6%)
  - System should auto-tighten SL to safe distance
  - Trades should execute with adjusted SL
  Expected: trades > 0 (entries allowed with adjusted SL)
  Note: This requires config override to set on_sl_beyond_liq=adjust
